# What is the Nature Data Project (draft)

**Mission**&#x20;

The "Github for Nature" Data Catalog is a global catalog of datasets and derivative models, public and private, to enable a new global data infrastructure in support of any nature disclosure framework. The catalog aims to mobilise public and private sector action towards the Global Biodiversity Framework objectives. The project is starting with support for the Task Force for Nature Related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) and LEAP Assessment approach to enable organizations to rapidly measure and respond to nature-related risks and opportunities.&#x20;

**Benefits**

The project adds value for consumers of data by providing benefits across datasets and models including normalization, standardization, aggregation, metadata data, and curation.&#x20;
