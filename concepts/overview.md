# Overview

The purpose of the Nature Data Catalog is to make biodiversity nature data accessible across ecosystem realms including land, freshwater, ocean, and atmosphere, so that governments, financial institutions, corporations, and NGOs can use the most complete, reliable and up to date data for their environmental data data work flows including science-based nature targets and disclosures (TNFD, SBTN, GRI 304 etc.). This also helps to avoid greenwashing that has historically plagued ESG.
