# What is the Nature Data Project (draft)

**Mission**&#x20;

The mission of the “Github for Nature” Data Catalog is to mobilise public and private sector action towards the Global Biodiversity Framework objectives. Starting with the LEAP approach, developed by the TNFD (Task Force for Nature Related Financial Disclosures, the catalog will to accelerate organizations to take greater responsibility for the nature-impact of their operations by minimizing redundancies, inefficiencies, and general confusion around locating relevant datasets and help ensure their disclosures are based upon fresh primary data to reduce the risk of greenwashing that can erode public trust.



**Benefits**

The project adds value for consumers of data by providing benefits across datasets and models including normalization, standardization, aggregation, metadata data, and curation.&#x20;
