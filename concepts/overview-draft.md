# Overview (draft)

The mission of the “Github for Nature” Data Catalog is to mobilize public and private sector action towards the Global Biodiversity Framework objectives. Starting with the LEAP approach, developed by the TNFD (Task Force for Nature Related Financial Disclosures) and with SBTN, GRI 304 and other framework support planned, the catalog will to accelerate organizations to take greater responsibility for the nature-impact of their operations by minimizing redundancies, inefficiencies, and general confusion around locating relevant datasets and help ensure their disclosures are based upon fresh primary data to reduce the risk of greenwashing that can erode public trust.

In this section you can learn more about the data catalog and also explore the data principles, development model, and usage.&#x20;
