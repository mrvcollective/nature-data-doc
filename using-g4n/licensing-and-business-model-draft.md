# Licensing & Business Model (draft)

The responsibility of creating a Nature Data Catalog is too great for a single government, non-profit, or private sector organization. Our vision is to initiate a self sustaining business model and put all development and IP under a perpetual trust so that this crucial contribution can remain as a public good. Furthermore, we wish to ensure that data providers receive fair compensation and attribution for the services they provide.&#x20;
